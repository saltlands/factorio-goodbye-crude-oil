# Goodbye, Crude Oil #

A mod for Factorio

### What does it do? ###

This mod removes the oil processing and advanced oil processing technologies and recipes, and removes all crude oil deposits from the map. The Coal Liquefaction recipe is adjusted to not require production science packs, so it is available earlier in the game.

A new tech and recipe, Coal Compaction, uses steam and coal to produce petroleum gas, and a small amount of heavy oil. This new recipe replaces oil processing for a similar low-yield start. The heavy oil it creates must be stored until it can be cracked to light oil or used in oil liquefaction.

### Why? ###

The intent here is to change the game up just a little bit. Since crude oil deposits are infinite, forcing the use of coal liquefaction instead means you must continue supplying your petroleum and oil producers with raw resources. It does not necessarily make the game harder or easier, just a little different.

### Known Bugs ###

Crude oil barrel recipes (fill-crude-oil-barrel and empty-crude-oil-barrel) still exist and are still unlocked by the fluid-handling tech. While they appear as regular unlocks in the tech itself in data.raw, they don't appear to exist during mod startup time and cannot be removed that way.
